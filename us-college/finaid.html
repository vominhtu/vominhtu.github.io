                <h3>What forms of financial assistance are available to international students in the United States?</h3>
                <p>Besides government scholarships (e.g. <a href="http://www.psc.gov.sg">PSC</a>) and industry scholarships, tertiary education in the United States can also be funded through institutional merit scholarships, need-based financial assistance, and on-campus employment.</p>
                <p>Merit scholarships are grants awarded to individuals with outstanding academic caliber, athletic prowess, and special talents. Financial circumstances are usually not considered when scholarship applicants are evaluated. Many <a href="#scholarships">private, as well as a few public, institutions</a> offer merit scholarships to international undergraduates.</p>
                <p>Need-based financial assistance are grants awarded based on students' financial circumstances. They help to defray part - or in some cases, all – of the full cost of attendance for students from lower-income households. This means that many students only need to pay the amount that their family can afford to. Good as it may sound, a significant proportion of college students in the United States receive need-based grants. </p>
                <p>Many <a href="#finaid-schools">private institutions</a>, mostly liberal arts colleges, extend institutional need-based financial assistance to international students. Federal financial assistance from the United States government is unavailable to international students. Public schools do not offer need-based financial assistance to foreign students.</p>
                <p>Merit scholarships and need-based financial assistance may completely cover tuition fees, and sometimes even part of the cost of room and board. These grants do not need to be paid back post-graduation, and are bond-free in most cases.</p>
                <p>International students are also allowed to work on-campus up to 20 hours per week. However, annual wages only amount to a maximum of a few thousand dollars, which is paltry compared to the full cost of attendance at any 4-year college.</p>
