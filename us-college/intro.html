                <h3>How is the higher education landscape like in the United States?</h3>
                <p>Generally speaking, colleges in the United States can be sorted into two main groups:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>2-year community colleges that grant diplomas and associate's degrees,</li>
                    <li>4-year colleges that grant bachelor's degrees</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Instead of enrolling at a 4-year college from the beginning, a student might opt to spend 2 years at a community college, then transfer to a 4-year college to complete a bachelor's degree. However, this guide is only concerned with 4-year colleges.</p>
                <p>Within 4-year colleges in the United States, there are three main groups:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Public research universities</li>
                    <li>Private research universities</li>
                    <li>Private liberal arts, engineering and business colleges</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Great distictions exist among these three groups of 4-year colleges. More details are covered <a href="#college-vs-univ">here</a>, <a href="select.html#lac-vs-univ">here</a> and <a href="select.html#public-vs-private">here</a>.</p>

            <div class="question">
                <h3>What is special about colleges in the United States?</h3>
                <p>Most colleges in the United States put great emphasis on the <a href="#liberal-arts">liberal arts</a> education.</p>
                <p>In addition, there are many opportunities for institutional <a href="finaid.html">scholarships and financial assistance</a> for international undergraduate students. Such sources of funding are much rarer in the United Kingdom, Canada or Australia.</p>
            </div>
                
            <div class="question" id="liberal-arts">
                <h3>What is the liberal arts education?</h3>
                <p>A liberal arts curriculum emphasizes communication, crititical thinking and problem-solving skills, not specific knowledge.</p>
                <p>Students are required to explore a broad range of academic disciplines – including mathematics, natural and social sciences, humanities and foreign languages – in addition to their major.</p>
                <p>However, contrary to what the name "liberal arts" might suggest, students need not necessarily focus on the arts and humanities. In fact, they are free to choose mathematics or natural sciences to study in-depth.</p>
                <p>This approach to university education is embraced by most institutions of higher education in the United States, even tech-focused schools such as Massachussetts Institute of Technology. However, general education requirements differ from college to college.</p>
                <p>To write about majors, minors, double major.</p>

            <div class="question" id="college-vs-univ">
                <h3>How is a "college" different from a "university?"</h3>
                <p>Generally speaking, a college refers to an institution of higher education, while a university refers to an institution of higher education <b>and</b> research.</p>
                <p>A college may stand on its own, e.g. Williams College, or may be part of a university, e.g. Bourns College of Engineering is a sub-division of University of California--Riverside.</p>
                <p>A university, on the other hand, is often organized into multiple constituent colleges, only some of which teach undergraduates. The undergraduate division of a university is usually organized into a few specialized schools for majors such as business, engineering, etc. and a liberal arts school where the rest of the majors are taught. E.g., The University of Pennsylvania is organized into twelve different colleges, four of which offer bachelor's degree programs, namely School of Arts and Sciences, School of Engineering and Applied Science, Wharton School and School of Nursing.</p>
                <p>Nonetheless, "going to college" and "going to university" have the same meaning: receiving undergraduate education. </p>
                <p>However, in the United States, there may exist <a href="select.html#lac-vs-univ">great differences</a> between a stand-alone college and undergraduate colleges that belong to a university.</p>
                <p><i>Note: Sometimes, for historical reasons, a university may maintain the word "College" in its name, or vice versa, e.g. Dartmouth College is a research university, whereas Wesleyan University is a liberal arts college.</i></p>

            <div class="question">
                <h3>Which are good universities in the United States?</h3>
                <p>In the United States, there are over 1800 four-year universities and colleges. If 10 out of over 120 universities in the United Kingdom are deemed "excellent," then there should be at least 100 excellent institutions in the United States.
