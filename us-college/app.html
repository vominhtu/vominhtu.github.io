                <h3>What are the college application schemes and their respective deadlines in the United States?</h3>
                <p>While each college and university has its own deadlines for application submission, deadlines mostly depend on the application scheme you are applying under.</p>
                <p>Under the Early Decision scheme, students can apply to one, and only one, school. If admitted, the student is legally obligated to attend that college or university, and must withdraw all applications to other schools. There are two rounds of Early Decision. In the first round, applications are usually due in October, and outcomes are usually releashed in December. In the second round, applicants can switch the Regular Decision application at one school to Early Decision in January. Most schools offer round one of Early Decision.</p>
                <p>Under the Early Action scheme, students can apply to multiple schools. If admitted, the student has until May 1st to reply to each school whether to attend. Applications are usually due in November, and outcomes are usually released in January. Not many schools offer this scheme.</p>
                <p>Under the Regular Decision, students can apply to multiple schools. If admitted, the student has until May 1st to reply to each school whether to attend. Applications are usually due on January 1st, and outcomes are released by April 1st. Most schools offer this scheme.</p>
                <p>Under the Rolling Admission scheme, applications are continuously processed and outcomes are released according to the date of application submission. This scheme is usually offered at schools where admission is less competitive, usually public universities.</p>
                <p>Merit scholarships applications, at both private and public institutions, are usually due in December.</p>

            <div class="question" id="difference-us-uk">
                <h3>How is the college admission process in the United States different from Singapore, the United Kingdom and Australia?</h3>
                <p>In Singapore, the United Kingdom and Australia, the university admission process is largely merit-based. In other words, the most important factor when assessing a candidate is his or her academic caliber. Co-curricular activities and personal qualities are considered, but are not overriding factors.</p>
                <p>Many, mostly private, institutions in the United States employs the <a href="#holistic-admission">holistic admission</a> process. A candidate is assessed based on his or her academic caliber, out-of-class achievements and special talents, personal qualities and beliefs, and socioeconomic background.</p>

            <div class="question" id="application-material">
                <h3>What material is required in the college application in the United States?</h3>
                <p>While required application materials differ across institutions, usually the following are required:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A scan of grade 9 to 12 transcripts, meaning O Level, J1 Promotional, J2 Preliminary and Predicted A Level results, plus an explanatory note explaining what these results mean in Singapore</li>
                    <li>A counselor's report, commenting on your academic and extra-curricular achievements</li>
                    <li>Two recommendation letters from teachers of academic subjects, commenting on your academic caliber and personal qualities</li>
                    <li>SAT or ACT score, with essay score</li>
                    <li>A personal essay</li>
                    <li>A complementary essay explaining why the institution appeals to you and how you can contribute to the institution</li>
                    <li>TOEFL/IELTS scores, though this requirement is usually waived for Singaporean students</li>
                    <li>Financial support documents</li>
                </ul>
                <p>More competitive institutions often ask for the following additional materials:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Two SAT II scores</li>
                    <li>A complementary essay demonstrating your thought process, world view, ideals and beliefs</li>
                    <li>An interview</li>
                </ul>

            <div class="question" id="holistic-admission">
                <h3>How does the holistic admission process work?</h3>
                <p>In contrast to the merit-based university admission process used in Singapore, the United Kingdom and Australia—where the aim is to admit students with the highest academic caliber into each academic program—the holistic admission process aims to admit a well-rounded group of students into the institution.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="question" id="personal-essay">
                <h3>How should the personal essay be written?</h3>
                <p>The personal essay is the protocol for each student to demonstrate his or her uniqueness.</p>
                <p>Due to the 650-word limit, the essay is recommended to focus on one single moment, incident, or story, with ample details, illustrations and reflections. It is not recommended to cram too many events or ideas into one single essay with insufficient elaboration. Assuming most admission officer will be burdened with a ton of essays, ideally the essay should be able to give a lasting impression of you to the officer after just one read through: he or she should be able to summarize the essay into a one-sentence remark about how you are special.</p>
                <p>The scope of CommonApp essay prompts are very broad and students can effectively write about any subject they desire. However, stylistic elements aside, the narrative in the essay should zoom in on one area of substantial value, for example:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A personal quality, e.g. tenacity</li>
                    <li>A passion, e.g. for violin</li>
                    <li>A perception of the world, e.g. why a certain societal value exists, and your take on it</li>
                    <li>A personal belief, e.g. how a certain technology hampers social ties, and how this belief shapes your actions</li>
                    <li>An identity, i.e. how you define your position in your immediate environment</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Whatever the focus, the essay should be personal, i.e. it should be heavily tinged with personal circumstances and reflections, and ideas discussed should be contextualized into your immediate setting. E.g., if you discuss tenacity, you should illustrate how you define it via specific actions, how it manifests in your personal situations, and how your version of being tenacious is different from someone else's, etc.</p>
