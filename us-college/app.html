                <h3>What are the college application schemes and their respective deadlines in the United States?</h3>
                <p>While each college and university has its own deadlines for application submission, deadlines mostly depend on the application scheme you are applying under.</p>
                <p>Under the Early Decision scheme, students can apply to one, and only one, school. If admitted, the student is legally obligated to attend that college or university, and must withdraw all applications to other schools. There are two rounds of Early Decision. In the first round, applications are usually due in October, and outcomes are usually releashed in December. In the second round, applicants can switch the Regular Decision application at one school to Early Decision in January. Most schools offer round one of Early Decision.</p>
                <p>Under the Early Action scheme, students can apply to multiple schools. If admitted, the student has until May 1st to reply to each school whether to attend. Applications are usually due in November, and outcomes are usually released in January. Not many schools offer this scheme.</p>
                <p>Under the Regular Decision, students can apply to multiple schools. If admitted, the student has until May 1st to reply to each school whether to attend. Applications are usually due on January 1st, and outcomes are released by April 1st. Most schools offer this scheme.</p>
                <p>Under the Rolling Admission scheme, applications are continuously processed and outcomes are released according to the date of application submission. This scheme is usually offered at schools where admission is less competitive, usually public universities.</p>
                <p>Merit scholarships applications, at both private and public institutions, are usually due in December.</p>

                <h3>How is the college admission process in the United States different from Singapore, the United Kingdom and Australia?</h3>
                <p>In Singapore, the United Kingdom and Australia, the university admission process is largely merit-based. In other words, the most important factor when assessing a candidate is his or her academic caliber. Co-curricular activities and personal qualities are considered, but are not overriding factors.</p>
                <p>Many, mostly private, institutions in the United States employs the holistic admission process. A candidate is assessed based on his or her academic caliber, out-of-class achievements and special talents, personal qualities and beliefs, and socioeconomic background.</p>
