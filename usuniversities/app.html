                <h3>How is the college admission process in the United States different from Singapore, the United Kingdom and Australia?</h3>
                <p>In Singapore, the United Kingdom and Australia, the university admission process is largely merit-based. In other words, the most important factor when assessing a candidate is his or her academic caliber. Co-curricular activities and personal qualities are considered, but are not overriding factors.</p>
                <p>Many, mostly private, institutions in the United States employs the holistic admission process. A candidate is assessed based on his or her academic caliber, out-of-class achievements and special talents, personal qualities and beliefs, and socioeconomic background.</p>
